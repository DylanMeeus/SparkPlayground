# Covid Dataset

This is me playing around with a covid dataset. 
What kind of questions can we ask from this data?

* Read as CSV -> Store as Parquet (For Performance!)
* Filter data for only the relevant bits
* Store in SQL to test Postgres connector
* Total infections (total / per country)
* Total deaths (total / per country) 
* Average Deaths / country
* Average daily deaths in a country
* Daily Deaths
* Daily Infections
